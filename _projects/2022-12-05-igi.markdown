As an Intermediate Programmer at Antimatter Games from July 2021 to January 2023, I played a key role in the development of IGI Origins, a stealth FPS game using Unreal Engine and C++. I was entrusted with leading a specialized AI task force of four, focusing on elevating the game's AI system.

In this capacity, my responsibilities expanded beyond programming tasks to encompass task delegation, regular updates, and acting as the primary point of contact for all AI-related matters.

Throughout this period, I had the opportunity to contribute to both Gameplay and AI features, refining my skills in Unreal Engine and C++. This involved extensive work in debugging, writing documentation, and collaborating with multiple departments, showcasing a versatile and comprehensive approach to game development.
