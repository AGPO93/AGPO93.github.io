#### Create behaviours for NAO using visual coding blocks

This project's prototype was <b>chosen as one of the best in the Faculty</b>, and I got the opportunity to showcase it at an open event on January 2019 at the Colston Hall in Bristol.

Take a look at an early stages [prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YFnfZBKT6Q) of this project. ###### get rid of

I built a Visual Programming Language (VPL) using the JavaScript library Blockly, to create behaviours for the NAO robot. The idea is that by using visual coding blocks, inexperienced programmers can learn basic concepts of programming, whilst receiving feedback from the robot running the behaviours.

Take a look at a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKX3VJ4p2M4) video I made for this project.
