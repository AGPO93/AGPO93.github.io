#### Python Learning Tool

<br><b>In progress.</b>

Take a look at an early stages [prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YFnfZBKT6Q) of this project.

Learn to code in Python by creating behaviours for the NAO robot and complete different tasks by utilising NAO's capabilities in order to obtain points and progress within this gamified environment.

This project was chosen as one of the best in my course, and I got the opportunity to showcase it at an open event on January 2019 at the Colston Hall in Bristol.
