#### Worked as an Associate Developer at SG for two years
<br>

From July 2019 to July 2021, I was an Associate Developer for Scientific Games in Bristol, United Kingdom, and remotely during the pandemic.

Here I shipped six casino titles, including one of the most played in the company in 2021: Marvelous Mouse. This was a great opportunity to learn about
the full development cycle of games.

I got a lot of valuable experience working as part of a self organizing Agile team, focusing on the programming of game features with an object oriented approach
using Typescript and Javascript.

I also led small teams in three projects, mentored junior developers, and participated in code reviews.
