#### WaveRun
<br>
WaveRun is a simple 2D platformer game I made for my first ever game jam, the Global Game Jam in January 2017, working with 4 other friends for 2 days. The entire game was made using Unity.
The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level dodging obstacles and jumping on platforms whilst being pursued by a giant wave.

It goes without saying the theme of the game jam was "Waves".
