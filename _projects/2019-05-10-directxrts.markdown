#### Features A* pathfinding, and more
<br>

I built this DirectX 11 engine in C++ from the ground up, with a focus on its rendering pipeline, and the implementation of a Real Time Strategy system capable of moving units in squad formations, making use of the pathfinding algorithm A*.

The engine features rendering techniques such as instancing to render hundreds of models putting minimum strain on the GPU.

Other elements such as input systems, texturing, and lighting were also implemented.
