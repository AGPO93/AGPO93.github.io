#### Made for a 2-Week long, randomized theme Gamejam
<br>
For this Gamejam we used a random theme generator, which came up with: "A heist with celebrities constantly jumping through windows". Not the easiest theme!

You're helping a random celebrity steal an Oscar, and your objective is to drive them to safety as fast as possible. As for the "constantly jumping through windows", we added several windows (with destructible meshes) you can drive through.

I fulfilled the role of Gameplay Programmer and Game Designer - I worked specifically on the camera system, and developed my own car behaviour/controller using wheel colliders. Not the prettiest car model, but it gets the job done!
