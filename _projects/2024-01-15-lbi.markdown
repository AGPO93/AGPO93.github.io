#### At Lost Boys Interactive
<br>

During my role as a Software Engineer at Lost Boys Interactive (January 2023 - January 2024), I made significant contributions to a Colony Sim game, leveraging C++ and Unreal Engine 5. I engineered intricate architecture and algorithms, particularly focusing on combat Gameplay and AI features.

A notable achievement was the development of a sophisticated combat system for strategic colonist group management, seamlessly integrating new gameplay components and enhancing the existing AI architecture.

In addition to coding, I translated design documents into detailed technical documentation, ensuring comprehensive solutions and conducting precise task estimations for effective project planning.

Engaging in proactive code reviews, I addressed peer feedback, providing constructive input that contributed to the continuous improvement of engineering practices.
