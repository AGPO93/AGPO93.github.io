#### Made for a 2-Week long, randomized theme Gamejam
<br>
The theme of this Gamejam was remaking a modern day game into an Atari 2600 version.

We decided to make a 70s version of Rocket League, featuring 1v1 and 2v2 modes.

For this project I had the role of Gameplay Programmer, and worked on the 2D car controller and the overall game design.

Have a look at the source code for this game [here](https://github.com/AGPO93/RocketLeague2600).
