#### Modular Unity dialogue system - easily create dialogue trees of any size
<br>
I created this customisable dialogue system in Unity, through scripts. Editing, adding, and removing conversation nodes is very easy since it was built using arrays.
It is also possible to trigger events in specific nodes of the conversation, such as turning lights off.
