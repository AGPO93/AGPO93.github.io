#### Work in progress
<br>

The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with the interactions between C++ classes and blueprints, and the features that it displays were made using C++.

Some of these features are collisions, player and camera movement, spawning of objects and NPCs, pickups, HUD, and animations.
