#### All components made with C++ classes
<br>

The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with the interactions between C++ classes and blueprints.

This project features: collisions, player and camera movement, combat system, spawning of objects and NPCs, pickups, HUD, and a pause menu with saving and loading functionality.
