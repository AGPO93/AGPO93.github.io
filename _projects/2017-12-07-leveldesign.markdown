#### Used design principles and implemented game mechanics
<br>
This game experience featured different technical elements such as AI agents, physics, particle systems and lighting. The project was created to explore the Unreal Engine 4 and its capabilities, and to put into practice level design principles. 

The projectile prefab was made so that they would iluminate the scene and instantiate particle systems upon collision.

Doors around the level and AI agents have behaviours that change when the player is in range.

Power ups, pick up items, and moving platforms were also implemented and placed around the level to work as challenges and to motivate the player to go to certain areas.
