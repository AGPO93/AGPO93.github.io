#### Used design principles and implemented game mechanics
<br>
This game experience featured different technical elements such as AI agents, physics, particle systems and lighting. The project was created to explore the Unreal Engine 4 and its capabilities, and to put into practice level design principles. 

Doors around the level and AI agents have behaviours that change when the player is in range.

The projectile prefab was made so that they would iluminate the scene and instantiate particle systems upon collision.
