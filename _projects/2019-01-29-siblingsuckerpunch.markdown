#### Sibling Suckerpunch
<br>
Reminiscent of fighting with your brother, in this 2.5D 2-player brawler you need to fight it out without destroying too much of your room! If your mother hears too much havoc by breaking the furniture she'll tell off the least damaged brother, but be finished before dinner gets cold else she'll come up either way!

I worked on this project as a part of a team of 5 for the Global Game Jam 2019, which we <b>WON!</b>

I fulfilled the role of programmer for most of it, and worked on in-game events, particle systems, dialogues, cutscenes, and other features that helped polish the game.
