#### Repair laptops as fast as you can!
<br>
Workshop is a 2D multiplayer game that I made working in a two-man team for PlayWest's Cyber Security Game Jam in May 2017.

In this game, the objective is to repair as many laptops as possible, by placing it in the right workstation and successfully completing a minigame to get rid of the issue. It's a possibility that laptops have more than one thing wrong with them, in which case you'd have to complete multiple minigames.
After a laptop has been fully repaired, it must be shipped out for it to add to your score.
The 3 workstations represent 3 different cyber security threats: viruses, contaminated USBs, and encryption.
