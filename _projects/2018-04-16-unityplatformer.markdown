#### Featuring combat system, AI, and more
<br>
3D platformer game developed in Unity.

So far it features a player that can run, jump, and attack, power-ups, enemies that patrol specific areas, attack, and also spawn smaller enemies when they die.

The level design its still in very early stages, and so far there is moving platforms (that follow splines), and that can be activated by specific triggers (such as the player standing on one).
