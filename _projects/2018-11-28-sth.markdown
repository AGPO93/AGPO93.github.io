#### Another PlayWest IP
<br>
Super Trash Heroes is another of PlayWest's IPs, and for this two week Gamejam we had to develop a new game using assets from the original game.

We decided to make it a multiplayer Brawler, in which one team's objective is to recycle whilst the other team pollutes the city.

I worked as a Gameplay Programmer and Designer in this project.
