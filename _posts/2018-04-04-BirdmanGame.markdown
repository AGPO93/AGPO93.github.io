<b>Birdman The Game<b/>

Having been set the task of developing a game inspired by the movie Birdman, my teammates and I decided to Warioware type of game, featuring several minigames and a "hub" that would work as a minigame on its own, in order to keep the player on his toes at all times.

<b>Presentation feedback<b/>

After pitching our idea, we were given the green light to start the development process of the game, however, we were told to find a way to give more meaning to the hub area, since in the game we pitched it only served as a lobby to access the game and lacked importance.
