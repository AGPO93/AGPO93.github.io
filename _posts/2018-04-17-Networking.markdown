<b>The Spec<b/>

As a final assignment, we were given the task to develop a turn based combat game featuring a networking system that allows players to connect to a lobby, and a chat system on top of the turn based mechanic.
We decided to develop a Heroes of Might and Magic type of game, inspired mainly by South Park The Fractured But Whole. This meant our game would have the turn based combat mechaninc, with each player having to form his team in the lobby choosing from a number of characters with different abilities (attacks, heal, etc). After each player is ready, the game starts and there is only one action allowed per turn, with the option of fleeing or surrendering.

<b>Development Process<b/>

After doing a fair amount of planning we delegated tasks to all the members of our team
