In the end I decided to go for my second idea.

Even though it's a very simple game, it feels more enjoyable than just endlessly moving a snake whilst eating apples.
The key aspect of this game is definitely it's challenge.

Learning about <b>vectors</b> made the implementation of the multiple moving obstacles possible, which made me struggle for a couple of days.

The game can certainly be improved, possibly by adding power-ups and other features like most people did. 

In terms of bugs present, the only one I can think of is that you can press 2 keys at the same time and it'll make the snake move over its own body. I could've addressed this by having it only take input after the movement has been processed.
