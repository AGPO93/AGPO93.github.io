<b>Update 26/10/17<b/>

Implentation of highscores is required.

<b>On previous notes:<b/>
- Adding different levels with obstacles isn't innovative, but I should keep that feature anyway.

<b>New possible features:<b/>
- Make it a story based game.
- Get rid of the snake 'growing' mechanism and turn it around: every time the snake eats something, it speed increases, and the challenge of the game changes to controlling a really fast snake instead of a very large one.

To increase complexity, final project could include different game modes.
