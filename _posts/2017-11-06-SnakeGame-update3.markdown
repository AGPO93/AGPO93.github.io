After finally implementing the mechanics of the classic <b>Snake</b> game, I will now add in some features to separate my version of Snake from the original one.

I came up with several ideas i've been posting in my blog throughout my development process, but I've managed to narrow it down to 2 features which will make 2 fairly different games:

- <b>The infinite snake:</b>
  The snake starts growing as soon as the game starts, and won't ever stop doing so. Movement speed will be rather fast, and there'd be static obstacles present in the level. The problem with this then becomes the replayability of the game, as it's very repetitive.

- <b>No cool title this time:</b>
  The snake's size doesn't change at all (it'll always be 3 blocks), there are blocks (obstacles) shooting from the right side of the screen to the left, which the player will have to avoid.
  Ideally, the obstacles will spawn at a random Y position and move at a speed which will increase with time, making it impossible for the player to survive eventually.
  This idea sounds a bit harder to implement but, much more promising in terms of gameplay.
