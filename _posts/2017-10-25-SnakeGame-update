<b>Update 25/10/17<b/>

2 player game mode discarded.

<b>New possible features:<b/>
- Make it time based, with the objective of the game being collecting the food under an X amount of time, whilst dodging obstacles.
- Adding different levels, with the difficulty increasing progressively (moving obstacles, mazes)
- Adding 'boosts' that change snake speed, give the snake abilities, etc.
