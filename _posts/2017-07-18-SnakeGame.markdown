We've been given the task to design an improve the game <b>'Snake'<b/> by adding or modifying features of the original game.

Here are the possible changes I will be implementing in my version of Snake:

- 2 player game mode: 2 players battle each other in a snake 'wrestling' match, where the objective is to eat the rival snake by tackling it's tail.


<b>Update 25/10/17<b/>

2 player game mode discarded.

<b>New possible features:<b/>
- Make it time based, with the objective of the game being collecting the food under an X amount of time, whilst dodging obstacles.
- Adding different levels, with the difficulty increasing progressively (moving obstacles, mazes)
- Adding 'boosts' that change snake speed, give the snake abilities, etc.


<b>Update 26/10/17<b/>

Implentation of highscores is required.

<b>On previous notes:<b/>
- Adding different levels with obstacles isn't innovative, but I should keep that feature anyway.

<b>New possible features:<b/>
- Make it a story based game.
- Get rid of the snake 'growing' mechanism and turn it around: every time the snake eats something, it speed increases, and the challenge of the game changes to controlling a really fast snake instead of a very large one.

To increase complexity, final project could include different game modes.
